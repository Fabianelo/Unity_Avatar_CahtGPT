Before you can start using the code you need an Azure account and an OpenAI account.
Make sure you put your keys in the "Credentials.cs" file.

To start interacting with the avatar press the space bar and when the chat box turns red speak into the microphone.

The default language is Spanish. You can change it in the Text to Speech (TTS) and Speech to Text (STT) configuration files.
